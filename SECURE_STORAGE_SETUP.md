# Secure Private Storage Options

Since todos contain private information, here are secure storage solutions:

## Option 1: Private GitHub Repository (Recommended)
1. Create a **PRIVATE** repository on GitHub (e.g., `my-private-todos`)
2. Generate a GitHub token with `repo` scope
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   GITHUB_PRIVATE_TOKEN=your_token_here
   GITHUB_PRIVATE_REPO=yourusername/my-private-todos
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=auto_generated_on_first_run
   ```
4. Todos are encrypted before upload

## Option 2: Dropbox (Easy Setup)
1. Get Dropbox access token from [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps)
2. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=auto_generated_on_first_run
   ```
3. Todos are encrypted and stored in your Dropbox

## Option 3: AWS S3 (Enterprise)
1. Create an S3 bucket
2. Create IAM user with S3 write permissions
3. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key_id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=auto_generated_on_first_run
   ```

## Option 4: Railway Persistent Volume (Simplest)
1. Add to `railway.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "volumes": [
       {
         "mount": "/app/data",
         "name": "todo-storage"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
2. Todos are encrypted and stored on Railway's persistent volume

## Option 5: Email Yourself (No Storage)
Instead of storing, email yourself the todos:
1. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   ```
2. Todos are emailed to you instead of stored

## Security Features
- All todos are **encrypted** before storage
- Encryption key is generated automatically
- Even if storage is compromised, data remains encrypted
- No sensitive data in public repositories

## Monitoring Without Public Exposure
- Use the web dashboard locally: `python web_dashboard.py`
- Set up a private Notion/Airtable integration
- Use encrypted local storage with periodic email reports

## Important Notes
- **NEVER** commit todos.txt to a public repository
- **ALWAYS** use encryption for cloud storage
- Keep your encryption key secure (backup separately)
- Consider GDPR/privacy requirements for your region
